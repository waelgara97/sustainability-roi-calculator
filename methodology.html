            <h3>Overview of the Model</h3>
            <p>The ROI Calculator uses a comprehensive model based on industry-specific data and academic research to estimate the financial benefits of implementing sustainability rating services across four key categories. The model projects benefits over a 3-year period and compares them against the investment costs to calculate ROI.</p>
            
            <p>The four benefit categories are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Procurement Cost Savings</strong> - Efficiency gains and waste reduction in supply chain</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Value Impact</strong> - Financial value of reduced carbon emissions</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Mitigation Value</strong> - Reduced exposure to supply chain disruptions and regulatory penalties</li>
                <li><strong>Brand Value / Market Access</strong> - Enhanced reputation and access to new markets</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Detailed Calculation Methodology by Benefit Category</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Procurement Cost Savings</h4>
            <p>Cost savings are calculated based on identifying inefficiencies, reducing waste, and implementing more sustainable practices in the supply chain.</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                Procurement Cost Savings = Procurement Spend × Industry Savings Factor × Maturity Adjustment × Growth Factor
            </div>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procurement Spend</strong>: Either user-provided or calculated as a percentage of revenue based on industry benchmarks (ranges from 25-70% depending on industry)</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Savings Factor</strong>: Potential savings percentage based on industry (ranges from 0.8% to 1.5%)</li>
                <li><strong>Maturity Adjustment</strong>: Factor based on current sustainability maturity level (Beginning: 1.0, Developing: 0.8, Established: 0.6, Advanced: 0.4, Leading: 0.3)</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Factor</strong>: Increase in efficiency over time (Year 1: 1.0, Year 2: 1.03, Year 3: 1.06)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="reference">Reference: The savings factors are derived from McKinsey's "Buying into a more sustainable value chain" (2021) study, which analyzed cost savings from sustainable procurement initiatives across multiple industries.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Carbon Value Impact</h4>
            <p>This represents the financial value of reduced carbon emissions in your supply chain.</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                Carbon Value Impact = (Procurement Spend × Industry Emission Factor × 0.001) × Carbon Price × Reduction Percentage
            </div>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procurement Spend</strong>: As defined above</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Emission Factor</strong>: kg CO2e per USD of spend (from EPA USEEIO model)</li>
                <li><strong>0.001</strong>: Conversion factor from kg to metric tons</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Price</strong>: User-defined carbon price (USD/ton), default: $50/ton</li>
                <li><strong>Reduction Percentage</strong>: Year 1: 15%, Year 2: 19.5%, Year 3: 25.4%</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="reference">Reference: Emission factors come directly from the EPA USEEIO model v1.3.0, which provides detailed supply chain emission factors by industry. Reduction percentages are based on World Economic Forum Net-Zero Industry Tracker (2024) data.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Risk Mitigation Value</h4>
            <p>This quantifies the value of reduced exposure to supply chain disruptions, regulatory penalties, and other sustainability-related risks.</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                Risk Mitigation Value = Base Risk Value × Industry Risk Level Factor × Revenue Scale × Maturity Adjustment × Growth Factor
            </div>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base Risk Value</strong>: Base value by risk level (High: $250,000, Medium: $150,000, Low: $100,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Risk Level Factor</strong>: Industry-specific risk level (based on regulatory exposure and emission intensity)</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Scale</strong>: Logarithmic scaling based on company size (Log10(Revenue) / Log10(1 billion))</li>
                <li><strong>Maturity Adjustment</strong>: As defined above</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Factor</strong>: As defined above</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="reference">Reference: Risk values are derived from industry risk analysis studies and adjusted for organization size. The logarithmic scaling ensures proportional risk values across different company sizes.</p>
            
            <h4>4. Brand Value / Market Access</h4>
            <p>This represents the positive impact on brand reputation and access to customers and markets that prioritize sustainability.</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                Brand Value Impact = Annual Revenue × Brand Value Percentage
            </div>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Annual Revenue</strong>: User-provided annual revenue</li>
                <li><strong>Brand Value Percentage</strong>: Year 1: 0.1%, Year 2: 0.15%, Year 3: 0.2%</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="reference">Reference: These brand value percentages are conservative estimates based on market studies that demonstrate a correlation between strong sustainability performance and brand value/market access.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="methodology-section">
            <h3>ROI Calculation</h3>
            
            <p>The ROI is calculated using standard financial metrics:</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                ROI Ratio = Total Benefits / Total Investment
            </div>
            
            <div class="formula">
                Net Present Value (NPV) = Σ [Net Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t]
            </div>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Benefits</strong>: Sum of all benefit categories across 3 years</li>
                <li><strong>Total Investment</strong>: Sum of service investment costs across 3 years</li>
                <li><strong>Net Cash Flow_t</strong>: Benefits minus Investment in year t</li>
                <li><strong>r</strong>: Discount rate (10%)</li>
                <li><strong>t</strong>: Year (1, 2, or 3)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The payback period is calculated by determining the point at which cumulative net benefits equal or exceed the cumulative investment costs.</p>

            <p>While the calculator provides valuable insights, users should be aware of the following limitations:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Results are estimates based on industry averages and may vary based on your specific organization's characteristics</li>

                <li>The calculator does not account for all potential benefits (e.g., employee retention, innovation)</li>
