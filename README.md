3. **Risk Mitigation Value** - Reduce exposure to supply chain disruptions and regulatory penalties
4. **Brand Value / Market Access** - Enhance reputation and access to new markets

## Features

- Comprehensive coverage of 23 NAICS industry sectors
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Financial metrics including ROI ratio, payback period, and NPV
